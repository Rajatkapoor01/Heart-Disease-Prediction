1. Age:

There is no "normal" age for heart disease prediction, but younger people generally have a lower risk.
Your age: 24 (which is typically considered a low-risk age group, but other factors are also important).
2. Chest pain type:

0 = Typical Angina (normal): Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.
1 = Atypical Angina: Chest pain with an unclear pattern.
2 = Non-Anginal Pain: Chest pain not related to heart issues.
3 = Asymptomatic (normal): No symptoms of chest pain.
3. Serum Cholesterol (mg/dl):

Normal range: 125â€“200 mg/dl
Below 200 mg/dl is generally considered normal.
Your value: 0 (you might want to use a valid cholesterol value for prediction).
4. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved:

Normal maximum heart rate (in exercise): 220 minus your age (for age 24: 220 - 24 = 196 beats per minute).
Your value: 0 (a valid heart rate should be used).
5. ST Depression Induced by Exercise:

Normal: 0.0 mm
Abnormal: Anything above 0.1 mm.
This value represents changes in the heart's electrical activity during exercise.
Your value: 0 mm (which is normal).
6. No. of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy:

Normal range: 0-3.
0 means no major vessels are affected by blockages (normal).
7. Thalassemia Status:

0 = Normal (no defect).
1 = Fixed defect (scar tissue; permanent damage).
2 = Reversible defect (blockage, but it can be treated).
Your value: 0 (normal thalassemia status).
